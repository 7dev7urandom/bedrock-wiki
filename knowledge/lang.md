# Understanding .lang 

Bedrock Minecraft allows us to write the text in our addons as codes: For example `action.hint.exit.pig`. Then in the language files, we define these codes: `action.hint.exit.pig=Tap sneak to dismount`.

This workflow has two main advantages:
 - Consolidates all of your text into one location, allowing you to more easily check for spelling mistakes, and change text after the fact
 - Allows internationalization. We can provide `.lang` files for multiple languages, allowing us to translate the text in our addon.

## Where can lang-codes be used? 

Lang-codes can be used in any of the following places:
 - pack name
 - pack description
 - entity name
 - item name
 - books
 - signs
 - tellraw commands

As you can see, lang-codes can be used pretty much wherever you write text in your addon.

## Why use lang?

Even if you don't plan on translating your addon, using the `.lang` structure is advantageous, since it keeps all of your text in the same place, and makes it easier to edit, proof-read, and maintain.

## What is the structure?

Lang files are found under `my_pack/texts/`. You should download and view the vanilla packs to understand this structure better. There are two main file types that you should be concerned with:

`my_pack/texts/languages.json`: Contains a list of languages that your addon supports.
`language_LOCALIZATION.lang`: Contains the lang-codes for a specific language/localization (for example `en_US.lang` is for the USA)

You should create `languages.json`, and then one `.lang` file for each language you want to support. If you are only writing for english, you HIGHLY recommended to support both `en_US` and `en_GB` (great britain), even if you only copy/paste the `.lang` file.

## RP Vs. BP?

`.lang` files can be placed in both the resource pack, and the behavior pack. This is presumably to allow behaviors packs to function stand-alone without requiring a resource pack. In practice though, all localization should be done inside the resource pack. The only strings you should have in your BP `.lang` files are the `pack.title` and `pack.description`.

## Overriding vanilla lang-codes

It is completely allowed and encouraged to override vanilla language strings. For example, if you want to rename `Iron Ingots` to `Iron Rods`, you can do so with the lang file:

`item.iron_ingot.name=Iron Rod`

## Undefined lang-codes

Sometimes, undefined lang-codes will show up in-game, when this happens, they will show the entire lang-code instead of a string. A very common place where you will see this, is with an entity name:

`entity.sirlich:my_entity.name`

When you see these codes, you can simply copy them down into your `.lang` files. For example:

`entity.sirlich:my_entity.name=MY VERY COOL ENTITY`

## Whats with the %s?

Some lang-codes contain the concept of arguments. These are things the game passes into your lang-code. You represent these arguments with `%`s. These normally occur in dynamic strings, like commands:

Example: (`/say`)
`chat.type.announcement=[%s] %s`

In the example above, the first `%s` is replaced by the name of the entity doing the `/say`. The second `%s` is replaced by the string after the say.

## Useful vanilla-overrides

Remove the `[Entity Name]` from `/say` commands: `chat.type.announcement=%2`
