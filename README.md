# Technical Bedrock

This repository contains scripts and tools. The documentation can be found [here](https://sirlich.github.io/technical-bedrock/).

 - **Scripts:** I will put my random python snippets here. Enter and beware!
 - **Tools:** Stuff in here are more or less proper tools, and will come with instructions and explanations. Scripts may slowly become tools if I work on them.
