# Technical Bedrock

This repository serves as a dumping ground for my Technical Bedrock knowledge, as well as a place to put my scripts. I often use python to augment my development, and I will put the scripts I want to make public here.

There are three main sections to this repository:
 - **Knowledge**: I will put my general tips and write-ups here.
 - **Scripts:** I will put my random python snippets here. Enter and beware!
 - **Tools:** Stuff in here are more or less proper tools, and will come with instructions and explanations. Scripts may slowly become tools if I work on them.
