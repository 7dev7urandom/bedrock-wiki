# Getting Started with Addons

Creating addons is hard, often overwhelming work. This document will provide you with a jump-start guide to addon creation, with an emphasis on **"here is where to find more information"**, rather than rewriting everything here.

## Where can I get help?

You should join the following discord servers:

 - [Crucible](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN)
 - [Minecraft Commands](https://discord.gg/QAFXFtZ)
 - [Bedrock Scripting](https://discord.gg/46JUdQb)

## What editor should I use?

I highly suggest VSCode, or Bridge. Bridge is an editor designed specifically for editing Minecraft addons. You can [find more information on editors here](/knowledge/the-editor). You should also be using a [JSON-Schema](/knowledge/using-schema)

## OK but how do I actually get started?

The best place to start is probably the [Minecraft Bedrock Beginners Guide](https://guide.bedrock.dev/). You should also bookmark the [Minecraft Bedrock Documentation](https://bedrock.dev/). After that, your best bet is to just try things! Download the vanilla Behavior Pack and Resource Pack. Poke around. Try changing things.

## What if my addon doesn't work?

You will need to debug your entity. The [troubleshooting page](/knowledge/troubleshooting) can be useful.
