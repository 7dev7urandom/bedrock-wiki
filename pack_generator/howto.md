# Pack Generator
Pack generator is a simple script for creating blank Resource/Behavior packs.

The imagined use case is quickly and easily having the ability to summon an entity into a world. This is useful just to make sure "everything is working" before you begin importing models.

**Features:**
 - Randomizes UUIDs, so each pack is unique
 - Includes a "box" and a "dummy" entity, which provide clean examples of renderable and invisible entities.
 - Include base structure for most commonly used features.

## How to run:
This script uses python 3.x.

Run: `python create.py` from the parent folder (pack_generator).

You can drag the blank_RP and blank_BP from the `out` folder directly into your world.
