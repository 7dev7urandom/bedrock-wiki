# Docs Generator

This is a tool to pull all component definitions out of the vannila Behavior Pack, and format them nicely.

Just drag `generator.py` into a folder full of entities (such as the vannila entities folder) and run `python generator.py`. The output is stored in `components.md`

You can find my output [here](../../knowledge/vannila_components/).
