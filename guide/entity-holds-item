**Warning:** this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of entities, loot tables and Blockbench. Make sure to check out the [tutorial](/guide/custom-entity-full) on entities, the [tutorial](/guide/loot_tables-recipes-spawn_rules) on loot tables and the [tutorial](/concepts/creating-entity-visuals) on blockbench before starting this tutorial.

In this tutorial you will learn to have an entity spawn with an item in its hand. I'll be using a custom `mandalorian_armorer' entity and a custom `hammer` item for the examples.

# Basic Usage

This section covers the main features of entities for them to spawn with an item in their hand.

## Setting up the model in blockbech

First of all, you'll need to have a model in Blockbench that has a map called 'rightArm'. Within this map, there needs to be a submap called 'rightItem'. Position the pivot point of this submap so it sits in the place you want the entity to hold the item at.

## Setting up behaviorpack-side entity

Now you'll need to add a `minecraft:equipment` component in the component list for you entity and add a loot table with the desired item.

```json
"components": {
    "minecraft:equipment": {
        "table": "loot_tables/entities/<your_loot_table_name>.json"
    }
}
```

In our example it will look like this:

```json
"components": {
    "minecraft:equipment": {
        "table": "loot_tables/entities/mandalorian_armorer_gear.json"
    }
}
```

## Setting up the loot table

Finally, add the loot table for the entity. It needs to be in `loot_tables/entities/<your_loot_table_name>.json` in the behavior pack. In our case, it's called `mandalorian_armorer_gear.json`. **:** This isn' the same loot table as what it drops on death. So make sure it has a different name.
To have the entity always spawn with the same item, add the following loot table:

```json
{
  "pools": [
    {
      "rolls": 1,
      "entries": [
        {
          "type": "item",
          "name": "<your_item_here>",
          "weight": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In our example it will look like this:

```json
{
  "pools": [
    {
      "rolls": 1,
      "entries": [
        {
          "type": "item",
          "name": "dd:hammer", // Custom item named 'hammer' with the identifier 'dd'.
          "weight": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If everything went well, you'll have something looking like this:
