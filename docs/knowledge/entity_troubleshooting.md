# Entity Troubleshooting

`Warning:` This article is incomplete. You can contribute to it by contacting `SirLich#1658` on Discord, or by making a pull request.

Adding entities into Minecraft is a fairly easy process *once you get a hang of it*. The first time is usually a difficult, bug-prone process. This document contains some tips and tricks for fixing those dastardly bugs, as well as best practice information.

The best way to prevent *invisible entity syndrome* and other nasty bugs is by setting yourself the correct environment. You should review The Editor document I wrote for my editor recommendations. The most  important part is getting a json-linter (or using an online tool).

The next thing you should do is turn on your content log. This can be done like: `Settings > Profile > Enable Content Log GUI`. Then press `ctrl+h` in-game to see any errors our output that might pop-up.

You should also download the vanilla resource and behavior pack. You can find these [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/addons/). You can compare against the vanilla files if you have any issues.
