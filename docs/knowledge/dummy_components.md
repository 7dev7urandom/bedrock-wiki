# Dummy Components

`Warning:` This article is incomplete. You can contribute to it by contacting `SirLich#1658` on Discord, or by making a pull request.

Dummy components are useless components that are only used for data storage. Dummy components don't **do** anything on their own. They need to be paired with secondary mechanics.

Good examples are `variant` and `mark_variant`. These components are used inside the Resource Pack to pick the different textures. So they are useful, but they won't automatically change textures for you.

Dummy components are good because it allows us to save data about our entity, and then query this data using Molang. 

## Known Dummies:
