# Docs Generator

This is a tool to pull all component definitions out of the vannila Behavior Pack, and format them nicely.

Just drag `generator.py` into a folder full of entities (such as the vannila entities folder) and run `python generator.py`. The output is stored in `components.md`

You can also use `generator_split.py`. Before using it though, you need to create an `out` directory at the same level. This is where all the generated docs will be stored.

You can find my output [here](../../knowledge/vanilla_components/).
